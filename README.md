# Reality AI Internship Contributions

## Overview
This repository highlights my contributions during my internship at Radical AI. I played key roles in the development of the **Marvel Platform**, an open-source teaching assistant AI project. My responsibilities included leading and co-leading the development of significant features such as the **Tool History Page** and **Onboarding** systems. All my contributions were successfully merged into the main repository, demonstrating my ability to deliver production-quality code and collaborate effectively in a team environment.

  - Built advanced features like exporting data to CSV and a copy-to-clipboard functionality.
  - Developed a skeleton loader to improve user experience during data fetching.
  - Designed and implemented the backend integration to fetch and categorize history data using Firebase Firestore and Redux.

  - Integrated Firebase Storage to handle profile image uploads only upon completing onboarding.
  - Focused on a polished, Figma-inspired UI for a modern user experience.
